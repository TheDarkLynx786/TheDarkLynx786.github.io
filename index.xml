        <description>&lt;p&gt;Desmos is a great math tool, but people also make some insane math art on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled in it too, here is a picture of a duck I made in Desmos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think that&amp;rsquo;s impressive? It&amp;rsquo;s time for myself to be humbled. Here is a gallery of some of my favorite art pieces for the Desmos Art Competition 2023.

&lt;p&gt;This one is actually a piano playing some music! You can do this through the &amp;quot;play graph&amp;quot; feature desmos offers. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yvchjdew6g&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Once again this was all Desmos! I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even do this with an actual paintbrush! Really amazing how these creative people managed to do it with mathematical equations. Once again, this stuff is really really cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go check them out in the gallery! I&amp;rsquo;ll see you in another post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;do-you-want-to-spice-your-breakfast-up-a-little-bit&#34;&gt;Do you want to spice your breakfast up a little bit?
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I&amp;rsquo;ve got the perfect recipe! This innovative and transformative omelette recipe is sure to leave the consumers of your food mildy amused!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just check out these reviews!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Looks like&amp;hellip;green eggs&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;-One of my chemistry classmates in 10th grade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s great!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;-My 10th grade chemistry teacher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;OMG I LOVE IT BEST THING EVER!!!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;-My brother&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey it&amp;rsquo;s actually not bad&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;-My cousin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;At this point you are using half my spice cabinet, move out already you liability&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;-(Not) My Mom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not convinced? Well then just check out the recipe yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;heres-the-recipe&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the Recipe
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1---egg&#34;&gt;Step 1 - Egg
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First find eggs. I think you may need eggs for this one (I recommend 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a bowl and something to beat your eggs with (like a fork) and beat up your eggs, with the yolk of course. Get it into a nice, even, yellow goop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-2---spices-phase-1&#34;&gt;Step 2 - Spices Phase 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get out some red chili powder and a good amount of salt. What, you expected quantities? Well, uhh, I&amp;rsquo;ll add them later I guess&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mix it up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-3---spices-phase-2&#34;&gt;Step 3 - Spices Phase 2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now listen carefully, you are gong to need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Italian Seasoning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garlic Powder (Too much works somehow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paprika (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garam Masala Powder (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shawarma Powder (substitute for GMP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lemon-Pepper Seasoning (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meat Tenderizer (optional; I actually never put this one in, and I likely don&amp;rsquo;t recommend it. Try it if you want)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cumin Powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Illicit substances, because at this point we&amp;rsquo;ve reached this far&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Okay for legal purposes, please ignore that last item.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still think I don&amp;rsquo;t belong in an asylum yet? Good! Now let&amp;rsquo;s continue making our omelette. Just to remind you, we are making an omelette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again, mix it all up! Ignore the possibly weird color, we are making the mother of all omelettes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-4---oil-and-pan&#34;&gt;Step 4 - Oil and Pan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a (hopefully non-stick) pan and some olive oil. Let it heat up until the oil flows fast on the pan (or you see olive oil vapor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this sits, move on to the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-5---solid-ingredients&#34;&gt;Step 5 - Solid Ingredients
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve cleared the spices, let&amp;rsquo;s add some solid ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheese (preferrably provalone or sharp cheddar)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Hold off putting this in the bowl for now, unless it&amp;rsquo;s shredded cheese)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onions (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chopped garlic (optional, recommended)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milk (this is a legitimate ingredient, helps fluffen up the egg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare to add them to the pan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-6---bread&#34;&gt;Step 6 - Bread
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is to transform your omelette into a sandwich, and is what I normally do. Ignore if you just want to omelette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toast some bread while you&amp;rsquo;re waiting for your pan to heat up. I currently have sourdough, but any bread of your taste will suffice. Toasting the bread adds a crunch, though you may not need to toast it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-7---cook&#34;&gt;Step 7 - Cook
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once your pan is hot enough, pour the egg batter onto the pan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting for one side to cook, start shredding your cheese up into bits and putting them on the top side of the cooking egg. If it&amp;rsquo;s shredded cheese, add a spoonfull more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the egg is hot enough, flip it over and let it cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid burning the cheese, flip it over quite frequently and move the egg around to not let the cheese stick to the pan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, once both sides look good, sprinkle some italian seasoning and maybe some more cheese on top, and turn the stove off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-8---serve&#34;&gt;Step 8 - Serve
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare your bread. Fold up the omelette and place on the bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to, add a condiment on the other slice of bread before making it into a sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have bread, simply roll up and serve like normal, and add some condiments to the side. Be artsy with the presentation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wow-you-did-it&#34;&gt;Wow you did it!!
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you can serve half-michellen-star, half-mediocre eggs to any guest you have over in the morning. This actually tastes good, trust. Feel free to play around with different steps in the process and experiment with your own egg recipe.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I swear I&amp;rsquo;ll add images later I&amp;rsquo;m doing college apps please&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As you know, I am a developer and whatnot, and this website itself is one of my projects! I do have several others though, some small and some big, and this is the page where I showcase them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some projects have executables which you can download to run on your own to test them out, and each project will have its own GitHub repository where you can see the code for it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx.com/p/website-contact-page/YouGotMail.png" alt="Featured image of post Website Contact Page" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello there! You&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of content on this website, haven&amp;rsquo;t you? Well you&amp;rsquo;re a good listener. Or reader. Whichever, you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m going to open up the floor (or simply a new page) where you can send me whatever&amp;rsquo;s on YOUR mind! (It&amp;rsquo;s a contact page, I made a contact page. This is way more dramatic than it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be, but hey, it&amp;rsquo;s a post, so I suppose there has to be some entertainment value.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now if you&amp;rsquo;ve got anything you want to say, feel free to shoot me a message!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form currently uses EmailJS, which is pretty basic in terms of a messenger service. I plan to switch to another one soon like Nodemailer where I can (or rather you can) send file attachments without purchasing a subscription. There was a plan to add a section like that, but that&amp;rsquo;s the point where the idea halted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a real note, try not to send anything hateful, and well, you know your digital ettiquette. I ain&amp;rsquo;t your mom or anything. Also, even if you do send something weird in: first of all, bruh, second of all, I&amp;rsquo;m likely to laugh it off anyway :).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Four Horsemen</title>
        <link>https://thedarklynx.com/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/fourhorsemen/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://thedarklynx.com/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/fourhorsemen/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx.com/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/fourhorsemen/FourHorsemen.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Four Horsemen" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Four Horsemen&amp;rdquo; is the album I created where I wanted to play around with creating metal tracks on JummBox. Due to its very MIDI nature, JummBox only has one guitar feature for a distinctly &amp;ldquo;metal&amp;rdquo; sound. I wanted to try and play around with the tools in JummBox and transform this guitar sound into something more than just its preset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse was kind of random, it just popped into my head. I did think it would make for a really sick theme for a series of metal tracks, and so I decided to center this album from the perspective of the four horsemen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, this uses the Cm/Gm phrygian notes, the ones that produce a really sick metal sound. I have also used certain riffs and musical themes from many different inspirations, ranging from Slipknot to MASTER BOOT RECORD, though they may not be apparently obvious. Check out each of the track descriptions for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elementals OST</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx.com/p/elementals-ost/Spark%20Ops.png" alt="Featured image of post Elementals OST" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call me the Iron Chef of BeepBox, cus I&amp;rsquo;m COOKING!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got involved in the creation of my first game soundtrack for a group of people. They seemed to like it quite a lot, and I certainly hope you all do to! You can listen to it here by clicking on the link &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedarklynx786.github.io/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/elementalsost/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;You should really just use the sidebar and find your way through&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, this soundtrack utilizes my signature scale, the Cm phyrgian scale. This time around however, I played around with volume control and and a bunch of other tools that I was somewhat unfamiliar with before, and I happened to get significantly richer sounds. A friend even wanted to sample &amp;ldquo;Bloodlust,&amp;rdquo; one of the tracks I made for this soundtrack. This composition was a big success, and I learned a whole lot about EQ filters and many different tools!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx.com/p/four-horsemen/FourHorsemen.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Four Horsemen" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the game soundtrack I made and the volume control experiments I was undertaking, I decided to undertake a composition series that depicted the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention it was metal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can go check it out here &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedarklynx786.github.io/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/fourhorsemen/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Use the sidebar :( Not that hard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again I was playing around with the same musical scale, nothing new there, but my experience from the previous music tracks that I made had taught me a lot about volume control, and I ended up making some great metal-sounding tracks that didn&amp;rsquo;t sacrifice sound quality to maintain the distorted metal guitar sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still releasing a few tracks, so keep a lookout for them! I&amp;rsquo;ll make an update post for when the whole project is finished.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elementals OST</title>
        <link>https://thedarklynx.com/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/elementalsost/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://thedarklynx.com/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/elementalsost/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx.com/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/elementalsost/Spark%20Ops.png" alt="Featured image of post Elementals OST" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This soundtrack was one I created while working in HackClub&amp;rsquo;s Arcade Summer Hackathon. I collaborated with a bunch of people to create a Roblox game, where I was the sound designer and track composer. I had a lot of fun, and I ended up creating some of my favorite tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was previously called SparkOps with the idea in mind that we can shoot electricity out of our guns as a game mechanic, but then we settled on using all the elements through runes and renamed the game Elementals. The image was one we AI-generated for the cover page of our game. Makes a sick album cover!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, it really never gets old: I keep using notes that revolve around G and Cm. When they work together, they efficiently create a metal or rock atmosphere, hence why Cm is my favorite key signature and why the notes that it plays around with are often used in metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arcade required you to have a Github commit for each project you upload, so here is the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/TheDarkLynx786/Elementals-OST&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Github Repo&lt;/a&gt; for all the tracks and SFX I have designed for the project. You can also get access to the JSON files, so you can remix and play around with what I made (Note to self, make this a feature for all the tracks!).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Corporate Crusade Suite</title>
        <link>https://thedarklynx.com/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/corporatecrusadesuite/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx.com/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/corporatecrusadesuite/CorporateCrusade.png" alt="Featured image of post Corporate Crusade Suite" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is kind of my first &amp;ldquo;set&amp;rdquo; of tracks; calling it an album seems kinda wrong, so I&amp;rsquo;m deciding it to call it a &amp;ldquo;suite.&amp;rdquo; It started with the first track, &amp;ldquo;Corporate Crusade,&amp;rdquo; which was originally made for a game jam with 2 other friends of mine. Eventually I started working on the other tracks, and I soon wish to turn this into an OST for the actual game, which I will be trying to revive, develop, and finish into a decent top-down shooter. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much art to show because art is the one thing I&amp;rsquo;m lacking in game design, so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep a pixel art of the player sprite as a placeholder image for now. As I think of more level ideas, I will compose more tracks and maybe update these old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these tracks use the key of C minor, and are centered primarly around the notes G, Ab, and F. Different variations give each track its own identity. I would say this is kind of similar to the Prelude tracks in ULTRAKILL, so there&amp;rsquo;s my inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Website Music Section</title>
        <link>https://thedarklynx.com/p/website-music-section/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx.com/p/website-music-section/Composition.png" alt="Featured image of post Website Music Section" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve added a new Music Section to my site! It features all of the tracks I have worked on. This post is about a month old from when I am actually writing this (August 2nd, 2024), and that&amp;rsquo;s because it took some time to develop the music section into something I actually found suited my site. And it&amp;rsquo;s live! Go check it out &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedarklynx786.github.io/music/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Music Section!&lt;/a&gt; (Or you know, you can just click the tab in the sidebar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took quite some time to get lists working, so I eventually just defauted to using tile lists and making my own custom ones from the site&amp;rsquo;s theme. It worked really well! Gave me lot&amp;rsquo;s of CSS experience while I was at it. Future plans for the site do include using JavaScript to make more interactive elements. Let&amp;rsquo;s make this site more interesting, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx.com/music/Music%20Page%20Banner.png" alt="Featured image of post Music" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the music section of my website! I have been involved with music since the start of 2018 and I&amp;rsquo;m still running strong! I primarily play percussive instruments, though I have some knowledge of guitar and a little in piano. Here you can find covers that I&amp;rsquo;ve made or pieces that I have performed (Yet to be added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also compose electronic music using an online DAW I found called &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.beepbox.co/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;BeepBox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (developed by John Nesky) and a mod for BeepBox called &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://jummb.us/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;JummBox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t really have FLStudio or any other professional DAWs, so this will have to work for now. It is really simple to learn and you can make some awesome tracks with it! Below showcase some of the tracks I have made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to remix some of my tracks, you are welcome to use the download buttons to import the JSONs into BeepBox/JummBox! Feel free to play around and make your own versions, edits, or fixes to the track, but please give credit if you are willing to share!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;evening-lakeside-ride---6262024&#34;&gt;Evening Lakeside Ride - 6/26/2024
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;distance-13-miles&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: ~13 miles&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-logs&#34;&gt;The Logs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;start&#34;&gt;Start
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had gotten done with some of my work at around 6:30 PM, and I thought there would be no better time for me to go for another bike ride, as I already went swimming just yesterday. After packing some water in a drawstring bag, I refilled some air in my tires and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gear-shift-issues&#34;&gt;Gear Shift Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to stop nearby at an elementary school because my gear shifter was malfunctioning. It seemed like a project for a later time, and since it didn&amp;rsquo;t alter the ride too much I let it go for now. I stopped again at the high school nearby to drink up some water. I ended up downing 70% of the bottle in one go. Should&amp;rsquo;ve drank water &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; starting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lakeside-neighborhood&#34;&gt;Lakeside Neighborhood
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made my way through the labyrinthine neighbordhood that bordered the lakeside. I had to check maps several times to see if I was not lost, but a single long road had led me out. My legs were quite tired from swimming yesterday, and it just happened so that my gear shift was locked onto the highest setting (requiring the most strength out of my legs). Had to walk to bike some time as well as my quads began to feel a bit hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nature-trail&#34;&gt;Nature Trail
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw an elderly couple exit a nearby nature trail. Having seen this on the map before my trip, I decided to see what it was about. It was blanketed with trees, providing a nice shady area from the sun. Conveniently, it led me right to the city park, which just bordered the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;flooded-lake&#34;&gt;Flooded Lake
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lake had been flooding as of recent. On a slightly botched fishing trip the previous Saturday involving my cousins, we managed to find a fishing spot in what was originally a parking lot. The flooding was pretty bad, but it seemed to have abated ever so slightly today, as an area we visited near the lake before was not that flooded today. Still the beachside and the volleyball courts were all submerged, as well as many trees and picnic spots. Nevertheless, the lake never fails to provide a beautiful view, and I got some pretty cool pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-search-for-water&#34;&gt;The Search for Water
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After realizing I had to get home in an hour, I had to rush home quite fast. I was quite thirsty however, and since I previously downed my entire stock of cold water, I looked nearby for a place to refill. I came across the local Mexican grocery market, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t happen to see any water fountains there. Upon asking the butcher there, it didn&amp;rsquo;t like that would have helped either as they were only able to understand Spanish. So I left and decided I would just drink at home. I could&amp;rsquo;ve grabbed some water at the local Fuzzy&amp;rsquo;s, but I thought it wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did find of worth however was a water fountain station I managed to spot at a nearby park. This was a mediocre decision, as the water was warm and made me thirstier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;home-stretch-and-more-gear-shift-trouble&#34;&gt;Home Stretch (and More Gear Shift Trouble)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way back was also pretty straightfoward. I did have some problems with the gear shifting, now interfering with my pedalling. It seems like a project is due to get these back to workable condition. Nevertheless I did make it home and managed to get there just before my dad pulled into the driveway.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; created that analyzes skin conditions through a machine learning model. Though the model was mostly programmed by my friend, I did a lot of the website design and social media post desiging, and it took off! We took it to hackathons and are entering it into the Congressional App Challenge, which we hope to win. You can go support us at our &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/dermalyze/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt;, and our &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dermalyze.tech/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;website&lt;/a&gt; (which you can also go check out through the links page).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, stating the obvious, if you have a skin condition, please go test our project! We would love to hear feedback about what we made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this experience, I&amp;rsquo;m likely going to create a machine learning project of my own, as I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot through this experience. You can even see that I reused the website theme for our project site for my own lol. Keep an eye out for more posts to see what I&amp;rsquo;m going to be up to in the (hopefully) near future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About Me
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Murtaza Haque, and I&amp;rsquo;m a fervid programmer who loves to code stuff! I also do many other things that people refer to as &amp;lsquo;hobbies.&amp;rsquo; Combining these interests together, I made this website as an online warehouse or diary for all of the activities I undertake. You can expect to find many of my projects here as well as my personally curated blogs on some things that I like talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-can-you-expect-to-find-on-this-website&#34;&gt;So what can you expect to find on this website?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biking Tales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MATH, OHH LOTS OF MATH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me performing music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of my own music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other programming projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occassional meme or two?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website updates (no brainer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep philosophical questions nobody asked for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;And more! I&amp;rsquo;ll see what I can add to this website now and then. I might even embed some games on this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First post of many! Stay tuned for more!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx.com/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/ozymandias/OzymandiasMitryAnderson.png" alt="Featured image of post Ozymandias" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made this piece after playing around with some chords on a piano site (link on the main page). The progression was assisted by a really cool melody with a really cool preset, and soon it evolved into this track. I think the naming of this track was probably the best thing I&amp;rsquo;ve named, as the title seems to fit very well with how the track sounds. There is a cool music-box section and also a violin solo at the end, so check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the first track I made that was non-loopable and a full production.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx.com/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/chill-jam/Chill.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Chill Jam" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This track was inspired by those weird but good sounding ethereal-aesthetic drones that you sometimes find on YouTube, and also a little bit by the OneShot OST. I also kind of wanted to encapsulate the feeling of stying nice and warm inside while it snows outside, which is certainly wishful thinking because there was no snow when I was creating this piece.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx.com/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/experiments/Experiments.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Experiments" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tracks showcased here are a bunch of play-around tracks I made before I got a little serious with making music on BeepBox/JummBox. They are pretty basic and a good place to look back to see how far I&amp;rsquo;ve come.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my links to profiles I&amp;rsquo;ve set up on different social platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t normally use that much social media so there aren&amp;rsquo;t that many. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this updated when I join any new platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
