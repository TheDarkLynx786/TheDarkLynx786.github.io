        <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;evening-lakeside-ride---6262024&#34;&gt;Evening Lakeside Ride - 6/26/2024
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;distance-13-miles&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: ~13 miles&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-logs&#34;&gt;The Logs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;start&#34;&gt;Start
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had gotten done with some of my work at around 6:30 PM, and I thought there would be no better time for me to go for another bike ride, as I already went swimming just yesterday. After packing some water in a drawstring bag, I refilled some air in my tires and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gear-shift-issues&#34;&gt;Gear Shift Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to stop nearby at an elementary school because my gear shifter was malfunctioning. It seemed like a project for a later time, and since it didn&amp;rsquo;t alter the ride too much I let it go for now. I stopped again at the high school nearby to drink up some water. I ended up downing 70% of the bottle in one go. Should&amp;rsquo;ve drank water &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; starting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lakeside-neighborhood&#34;&gt;Lakeside Neighborhood
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made my way through the labyrinthine neighbordhood that bordered the lakeside. I had to check maps several times to see if I was not lost, but a single long road had led me out. My legs were quite tired from swimming yesterday, and it just happened so that my gear shift was locked onto the highest setting (requiring the most strength out of my legs). Had to walk to bike some time as well as my quads began to feel a bit hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nature-trail&#34;&gt;Nature Trail
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw an elderly couple exit a nearby nature trail. Having seen this on the map before my trip, I decided to see what it was about. It was blanketed with trees, providing a nice shady area from the sun. Conveniently, it led me right to the city park, which just bordered the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;flooded-lake&#34;&gt;Flooded Lake
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lake had been flooding as of recent. On a slightly botched fishing trip the previous Saturday involving my cousins, we managed to find a fishing spot in what was originally a parking lot. The flooding was pretty bad, but it seemed to have abated ever so slightly today, as an area we visited near the lake before was not that flooded today. Still the beachside and the volleyball courts were all submerged, as well as many trees and picnic spots. Nevertheless, the lake never fails to provide a beautiful view, and I got some pretty cool pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-search-for-water&#34;&gt;The Search for Water
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After realizing I had to get home in an hour, I had to rush home quite fast. I was quite thirsty however, and since I previously downed my entire stock of cold water, I looked nearby for a place to refill. I came across the local Mexican grocery market, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t happen to see any water fountains there. Upon asking the butcher there, it didn&amp;rsquo;t like that would have helped either as they were only able to understand Spanish. So I left and decided I would just drink at home. I could&amp;rsquo;ve grabbed some water at the local Fuzzy&amp;rsquo;s, but I thought it wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did find of worth however was a water fountain station I managed to spot at a nearby park. This was a mediocre decision, as the water was warm and made me thirstier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;home-stretch-and-more-gear-shift-trouble&#34;&gt;Home Stretch (and More Gear Shift Trouble)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way back was also pretty straightfoward. I did have some problems with the gear shifting, now interfering with my pedalling. It seems like a project is due to get these back to workable condition. Nevertheless I did make it home and managed to get there just before my dad pulled into the driveway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About Me
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Murtaza Haque, and I&amp;rsquo;m a fervid programmer who loves to code stuff! I also do many other things that people refer to as &amp;lsquo;hobbies.&amp;rsquo; Combining these interests together, I made this website as an online warehouse or diary for all of the activities I undertake. You can expect to find many of my projects here as well as my personally curated blogs on some things that I like talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-can-you-expect-to-find-on-this-website&#34;&gt;So what can you expect to find on this website?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biking Tales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MATH, OHH LOTS OF MATH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me performing music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of my own music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other programming projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occassional meme or two?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Website updates (no brainer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep philosophical questions nobody asked for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;And more! I&amp;rsquo;ll see what I can add to this website now and then. I might even embed some games on this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t normally use that much social media so there aren&amp;rsquo;t that many. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this updated when I join any new platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
