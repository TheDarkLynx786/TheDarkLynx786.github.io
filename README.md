# Welcome to my Website!

Check it out! --> https://thedarklynx786.github.io

This website was made over the summer of 2024 to showcase all of my projects and act as a sort of a blog/diary. 

I'm going to be uploading a bunch of posts about cool stuff periodically and include cool sections for people to check out, like a music section that I have now, or a possible games section where I can embed games onto my website.

Currently, it houses all of my music projects (https://thedarklynx786.github.io/music), so go give those tracks a listen! All of the other things are under development.

If you have any inquiries, feedback, tech updates (for keeping my website state-of-the-art), or just something fun you want to share, feel free to contact me through the site (https://thedarklynx786.github.io/contact)!
