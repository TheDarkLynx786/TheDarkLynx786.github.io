        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx786.github.io/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/corporatecrusadesuite/CorporateCrusade.png" alt="Featured image of post Corporate Crusade Suite" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is kind of my first &amp;ldquo;set&amp;rdquo; of tracks; calling it an album seems kinda wrong, so I&amp;rsquo;m deciding it to call it a &amp;ldquo;suite.&amp;rdquo; It started with the first track, &amp;ldquo;Corporate Crusade,&amp;rdquo; which was originally made for a game jam with 2 other friends of mine. Eventually I started working on the other tracks, and I soon wish to turn this into an OST for the actual game, which I will be trying to revive, develop, and finish into a decent top-down shooter. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much art to show because art is the one thing I&amp;rsquo;m lacking in game design, so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep a pixel art of the player sprite as a placeholder image for now. As I think of more level ideas, I will compose more tracks and maybe update these old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these tracks use the key of C minor, and are centered primarly around the notes G, Ab, and F. Different variations give each track its own identity. I would say this is kind of similar to the Prelude tracks in ULTRAKILL, so there my inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx786.github.io/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/chill-jam/Chill.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Chill Jam" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This track was inspired by those weird but good sounding ethereal-aesthetic drones that you sometimes find on YouTube, and also a little bit by the OneShot OST. I also kind of wanted to encapsulate the feeling of stying nice and warm inside while it snows outside, which is certainly wishful thinking because there was no snow when I was creating this piece.&lt;/p&gt;

They are pretty basic and a good place to look back to see how far I&amp;rsquo;ve come.&lt;/p&gt;
