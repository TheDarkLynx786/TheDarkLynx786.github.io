You\u0026rsquo;ve been reading a lot of content on this website, haven\u0026rsquo;t you? Well you\u0026rsquo;re a good listener. Or reader. Whichever, you get the point.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m going to open up the floor (or simply a new page) where you can send me whatever\u0026rsquo;s on YOUR mind! (It\u0026rsquo;s a contact page, I made a contact page. This is way more dramatic than it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be, but hey, it\u0026rsquo;s a post, so I suppose there has to be some entertainment value.)\nSo now if you\u0026rsquo;ve got anything you want to say, feel free to shoot me a message!\nThe form currently uses EmailJS, which is pretty basic in terms of a messenger service. I plan to switch to another one soon like Nodemailer where I can (or rather you can) send file attachments without purchasing a subscription. There was a plan to add a section like that, but that\u0026rsquo;s the point where the idea halted.\nOn a real note, try not to send anything hateful, and well, you know your digital ettiquette. I ain\u0026rsquo;t your mom or anything. Also, even if you do send something weird in: first of all, bruh, second of all, I\u0026rsquo;m likely to laugh it off anyway :).\n","date":"2024-08-28T00:00:00Z","image":"https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/website-contact-page/YouGotMail_hued9b89802f639c8458699954729073af_44847_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/website-contact-page/","title":"Website Contact Page"},{"content":"Call me the Iron Chef of BeepBox, cus I\u0026rsquo;m COOKING!!\nI got involved in the creation of my first game soundtrack for a group of people.

It features all of the tracks I have worked on. This post is about a month old from when I am actually writing this (August 2nd, 2024), and that\u0026rsquo;s because it took some time to develop the music section into something I actually found suited my site.

After packing some water in a drawstring bag, I refilled some air in my tires and headed out.\nGear Shift Issues I had to stop nearby at an elementary school because my gear shifter was malfunctioning. It seemed like a project for a later time, and since it didn\u0026rsquo;t alter the ride too much I let it go for now. I stopped again at the high school nearby to drink up some water. I ended up downing 70% of the bottle in one go. Should\u0026rsquo;ve drank water before starting.\nLakeside Neighborhood I made my way through the labyrinthine neighbordhood that bordered the lakeside. I had to check maps several times to see if I was not lost, but a single long road had led me out. My legs were quite tired from swimming yesterday, and it just happened so that my gear shift was locked onto the highest setting (requiring the most strength out of my legs). Had to walk to bike some time as well as my quads began to feel a bit hot.\nNature Trail I saw an elderly couple exit a nearby nature trail. Having seen this on the map before my trip, I decided to see what it was about. It was blanketed with trees, providing a nice shady area from the sun. Conveniently, it led me right to the city park, which just bordered the lake.\nFlooded Lake The lake had been flooding as of recent. On a slightly botched fishing trip the previous Saturday involving my cousins, we managed to find a fishing spot in what was originally a parking lot. The flooding was pretty bad, but it seemed to have abated ever so slightly today, as an area we visited near the lake before was not that flooded today. Still the beachside and the volleyball courts were all submerged, as well as many trees and picnic spots. Nevertheless, the lake never fails to provide a beautiful view, and I got some pretty cool pictures.\nThe Search for Water After realizing I had to get home in an hour, I had to rush home quite fast. I was quite thirsty however, and since I previously downed my entire stock of cold water, I looked nearby for a place to refill. I came across the local Mexican grocery market, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t happen to see any water fountains there. Upon asking the butcher there, it didn\u0026rsquo;t like that would have helped either as they were only able to understand Spanish. So I left and decided I would just drink at home. I could\u0026rsquo;ve grabbed some water at the local Fuzzy\u0026rsquo;s, but I thought it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth the time.\nWhat I did find of worth however was a water fountain station I managed to spot at a nearby park. This was a mediocre decision, as the water was warm and made me thirstier.\nHome Stretch (and More Gear Shift Trouble) The way back was also pretty straightfoward. I did have some problems with the gear shifting, now interfering with my pedalling. It seems like a project is due to get these back to workable condition. Nevertheless I did make it home and managed to get there just before my dad pulled into the driveway.\nGallery ","date":"2024-06-26T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/6-26-2024-bike-logs/","title":"6-26-2024 Bike Logs"},{"content":"This post is made to advertise Dermalyze, a machine learning project me and a friend created that analyzes skin conditions through a machine learning model.

We would love to hear feedback about what we made.\nThrough this experience, I\u0026rsquo;m likely going to create a machine learning project of my own, as I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot through this experience.
