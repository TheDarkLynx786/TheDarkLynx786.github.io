[{"content":"*Images Coming Soon*\nDo you want to spice your breakfast up a little bit? Well I\u0026rsquo;ve got the perfect recipe! This innovative and transformative omelette recipe is sure to leave the consumers of your food mildy amused!\nJust check out these reviews!\n\u0026ldquo;Looks like\u0026hellip;green eggs\u0026rdquo; -One of my chemistry classmates in 10th grade\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s great!\u0026rdquo; -My 10th grade chemistry teacher\n\u0026ldquo;OMG I LOVE IT BEST THING EVER!!!\u0026rdquo; -My brother\n\u0026ldquo;Hey it\u0026rsquo;s actually not bad\u0026rdquo; -My cousin\n\u0026ldquo;At this point you are using half my spice cabinet, move out already you liability\u0026rdquo; -(Not) My Mom\nNot convinced? Well then just check out the recipe yourself!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the Recipe Step 1 - Egg First find eggs. I think you may need eggs for this one (I recommend 2).\nGet a bowl and something to beat your eggs with (like a fork) and beat up your eggs, with the yolk of course. Get it into a nice, even, yellow goop.\nStep 2 - Spices Phase 1 Get out some red chili powder and a good amount of salt. What, you expected quantities? Well, uhh, I\u0026rsquo;ll add them later I guess\u0026hellip;\nMix it up!\nStep 3 - Spices Phase 2 Now listen carefully, you are gong to need:\nItalian Seasoning Garlic Powder (Too much works somehow) Paprika (optional) Garam Masala Powder (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Shawarma Powder (substitute for GMP) Lemon-Pepper Seasoning (optional) Meat Tenderizer (optional; I actually never put this one in, and I likely don\u0026rsquo;t recommend it. Try it if you want) Cumin Powder Illicit substances, because at this point we\u0026rsquo;ve reached this far (Okay for legal purposes, please ignore that last item.)\nStill think I don\u0026rsquo;t belong in an asylum yet? Good! Now let\u0026rsquo;s continue making our omelette. Just to remind you, we are making an omelette.\nAnd once again, mix it all up! Ignore the possibly weird color, we are making the mother of all omelettes here.\nStep 4 - Oil and Pan Get a (hopefully non-stick) pan and some olive oil. Let it heat up until the oil flows fast on the pan (or you see olive oil vapor).\nWhile this sits, move on to the next steps.\nStep 5 - Solid Ingredients Now that we\u0026rsquo;ve cleared the spices, let\u0026rsquo;s add some solid ingredients:\nCheese (preferrably provalone or sharp cheddar) (Hold off putting this in the bowl for now, unless it\u0026rsquo;s shredded cheese) Onions (optional) Chopped garlic (optional, recommended) Milk (this is a legitimate ingredient, helps fluffen up the egg) Prepare to add them to the pan.\nStep 6 - Bread This is to transform your omelette into a sandwich, and is what I normally do. Ignore if you just want to omelette.\nToast some bread while you\u0026rsquo;re waiting for your pan to heat up. I currently have sourdough, but any bread of your taste will suffice. Toasting the bread adds a crunch, though you may not need to toast it.\nStep 7 - Cook Once your pan is hot enough, pour the egg batter onto the pan.\nWhile waiting for one side to cook, start shredding your cheese up into bits and putting them on the top side of the cooking egg. If it\u0026rsquo;s shredded cheese, add a spoonfull more.\nOnce the egg is hot enough, flip it over and let it cook.\nTo avoid burning the cheese, flip it over quite frequently and move the egg around to not let the cheese stick to the pan.\nAnd finally, once both sides look good, sprinkle some italian seasoning and maybe some more cheese on top, and turn the stove off.\nStep 8 - Serve Prepare your bread. Fold up the omelette and place on the bread.\nIf you want to, add a condiment on the other slice of bread before making it into a sandwich.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have bread, simply roll up and serve like normal, and add some condiments to the side. Be artsy with the presentation!\nWow you did it!! Now you can serve half-michellen-star, half-mediocre eggs to any guest you have over in the morning. This actually tastes good, trust. Feel free to play around with different steps in the process and experiment with your own egg recipe. I swear I\u0026rsquo;ll add images later I\u0026rsquo;m doing college apps please\n","date":"2024-08-31T00:00:00Z","image":"https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/my-special-omelette-recipe/Finished_hu6b0089dfc76c773286af954aef817b84_3931190_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/my-special-omelette-recipe/","title":"My Special Omelette Recipe"},{"content":"Hello there!

A friend even wanted to sample \u0026ldquo;Bloodlust,\u0026rdquo; one of the tracks I made for this soundtrack.

It features all of the tracks I have worked on. This post is about a month old from when I am actually writing this (August 2nd, 2024), and that\u0026rsquo;s because it took some time to develop the music section into something I actually found suited my site.

After packing some water in a drawstring bag, I refilled some air in my tires and headed out.\nGear Shift Issues I had to stop nearby at an elementary school because my gear shifter was malfunctioning. It seemed like a project for a later time, and since it didn\u0026rsquo;t alter the ride too much I let it go for now. I stopped again at the high school nearby to drink up some water. I ended up downing 70% of the bottle in one go. Should\u0026rsquo;ve drank water before starting.\nLakeside Neighborhood I made my way through the labyrinthine neighbordhood that bordered the lakeside. I had to check maps several times to see if I was not lost, but a single long road had led me out. My legs were quite tired from swimming yesterday, and it just happened so that my gear shift was locked onto the highest setting (requiring the most strength out of my legs). Had to walk to bike some time as well as my quads began to feel a bit hot.\nNature Trail I saw an elderly couple exit a nearby nature trail. Having seen this on the map before my trip, I decided to see what it was about. It was blanketed with trees, providing a nice shady area from the sun. Conveniently, it led me right to the city park, which just bordered the lake.\nFlooded Lake The lake had been flooding as of recent. On a slightly botched fishing trip the previous Saturday involving my cousins, we managed to find a fishing spot in what was originally a parking lot. The flooding was pretty bad, but it seemed to have abated ever so slightly today, as an area we visited near the lake before was not that flooded today. Still the beachside and the volleyball courts were all submerged, as well as many trees and picnic spots. Nevertheless, the lake never fails to provide a beautiful view, and I got some pretty cool pictures.\nThe Search for Water After realizing I had to get home in an hour, I had to rush home quite fast. I was quite thirsty however, and since I previously downed my entire stock of cold water, I looked nearby for a place to refill. I came across the local Mexican grocery market, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t happen to see any water fountains there. Upon asking the butcher there, it didn\u0026rsquo;t like that would have helped either as they were only able to understand Spanish. So I left and decided I would just drink at home. I could\u0026rsquo;ve grabbed some water at the local Fuzzy\u0026rsquo;s, but I thought it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth the time.\nWhat I did find of worth however was a water fountain station I managed to spot at a nearby park. This was a mediocre decision, as the water was warm and made me thirstier.\nHome Stretch (and More Gear Shift Trouble) The way back was also pretty straightfoward. I did have some problems with the gear shifting, now interfering with my pedalling. It seems like a project is due to get these back to workable condition. Nevertheless I did make it home and managed to get there just before my dad pulled into the driveway.\nGallery ","date":"2024-06-26T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/6-26-2024-bike-logs/","title":"6-26-2024 Bike Logs"},{"content":"This post is made to advertise Dermalyze, a machine learning project me and a friend created that analyzes skin conditions through a machine learning model.
