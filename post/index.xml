        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/website-contact-page/YouGotMail.png" alt="Featured image of post Website Contact Page" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello there! You&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot of content on this website, haven&amp;rsquo;t you? Well you&amp;rsquo;re a good listener. Or reader. Whichever, you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m going to open up the floor (or simply a new page) where you can send me whatever&amp;rsquo;s on YOUR mind! (It&amp;rsquo;s a contact page, I made a contact page. This is way more dramatic than it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be, but hey, it&amp;rsquo;s a post, so I suppose there has to be some entertainment value.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now if you&amp;rsquo;ve got anything you want to say, feel free to shoot me a message!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form currently uses EmailJS, which is pretty basic in terms of a messenger service. I plan to switch to another one soon like Nodemailer where I can (or rather you can) send file attachments without purchasing a subscription. There was a plan to add a section like that, but that&amp;rsquo;s the point where the idea halted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a real note, try not to send anything hateful, and well, you know your digital ettiquette. I ain&amp;rsquo;t your mom or anything. Also, even if you do send something weird in: first of all, bruh, second of all, I&amp;rsquo;m likely to laugh it off anyway :).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elementals OST</title>
        <link>https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/elementals-ost/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/elementals-ost/Spark%20Ops.png" alt="Featured image of post Elementals OST" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call me the Iron Chef of BeepBox, cus I&amp;rsquo;m COOKING!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got involved in the creation of my first game soundtrack for a group of people. They seemed to like it quite a lot, and I certainly hope you all do to! You can listen to it here by clicking on the link &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedarklynx786.github.io/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/elementalsost/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;You should really just use the sidebar and find your way through&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, this soundtrack utilizes my signature scale, the Cm phyrgian scale. This time around however, I played around with volume control and and a bunch of other tools that I was somewhat unfamiliar with before, and I happened to get significantly richer sounds. A friend even wanted to sample &amp;ldquo;Bloodlust,&amp;rdquo; one of the tracks I made for this soundtrack. This composition was a big success, and I learned a whole lot about EQ filters and many different tools!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Four Horsemen</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/four-horsemen/FourHorsemen.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Four Horsemen" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the game soundtrack I made and the volume control experiments I was undertaking, I decided to undertake a composition series that depicted the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention it was metal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can go check it out here &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedarklynx786.github.io/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/fourhorsemen/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Use the sidebar :( Not that hard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again I was playing around with the same musical scale, nothing new there, but my experience from the previous music tracks that I made had taught me a lot about volume control, and I ended up making some great metal-sounding tracks that didn&amp;rsquo;t sacrifice sound quality to maintain the distorted metal guitar sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still releasing a few tracks, so keep a lookout for them! I&amp;rsquo;ll make an update post for when the whole project is finished.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Website Music Section</title>
        <link>https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/website-music-section/</link>

        <guid>https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/website-music-section/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/website-music-section/Composition.png" alt="Featured image of post Website Music Section" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve added a new Music Section to my site! It features all of the tracks I have worked on. This post is about a month old from when I am actually writing this (August 2nd, 2024), and that&amp;rsquo;s because it took some time to develop the music section into something I actually found suited my site. And it&amp;rsquo;s live! Go check it out &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://thedarklynx786.github.io/music/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Music Section!&lt;/a&gt; (Or you know, you can just click the tab in the sidebar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took quite some time to get lists working, so I eventually just defauted to using tile lists and making my own custom ones from the site&amp;rsquo;s theme. It worked really well! Gave me lot&amp;rsquo;s of CSS experience while I was at it. Future plans for the site do include using JavaScript to make more interactive elements. Let&amp;rsquo;s make this site more interesting, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;evening-lakeside-ride---6262024&#34;&gt;Evening Lakeside Ride - 6/26/2024
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;distance-13-miles&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: ~13 miles&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-logs&#34;&gt;The Logs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;start&#34;&gt;Start
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had gotten done with some of my work at around 6:30 PM, and I thought there would be no better time for me to go for another bike ride, as I already went swimming just yesterday. After packing some water in a drawstring bag, I refilled some air in my tires and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gear-shift-issues&#34;&gt;Gear Shift Issues
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to stop nearby at an elementary school because my gear shifter was malfunctioning. It seemed like a project for a later time, and since it didn&amp;rsquo;t alter the ride too much I let it go for now. I stopped again at the high school nearby to drink up some water. I ended up downing 70% of the bottle in one go. Should&amp;rsquo;ve drank water &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; starting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lakeside-neighborhood&#34;&gt;Lakeside Neighborhood
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made my way through the labyrinthine neighbordhood that bordered the lakeside. I had to check maps several times to see if I was not lost, but a single long road had led me out. My legs were quite tired from swimming yesterday, and it just happened so that my gear shift was locked onto the highest setting (requiring the most strength out of my legs). Had to walk to bike some time as well as my quads began to feel a bit hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nature-trail&#34;&gt;Nature Trail
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw an elderly couple exit a nearby nature trail. Having seen this on the map before my trip, I decided to see what it was about. It was blanketed with trees, providing a nice shady area from the sun. Conveniently, it led me right to the city park, which just bordered the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;flooded-lake&#34;&gt;Flooded Lake
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lake had been flooding as of recent. On a slightly botched fishing trip the previous Saturday involving my cousins, we managed to find a fishing spot in what was originally a parking lot. The flooding was pretty bad, but it seemed to have abated ever so slightly today, as an area we visited near the lake before was not that flooded today. Still the beachside and the volleyball courts were all submerged, as well as many trees and picnic spots. Nevertheless, the lake never fails to provide a beautiful view, and I got some pretty cool pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-search-for-water&#34;&gt;The Search for Water
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After realizing I had to get home in an hour, I had to rush home quite fast. I was quite thirsty however, and since I previously downed my entire stock of cold water, I looked nearby for a place to refill. I came across the local Mexican grocery market, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t happen to see any water fountains there. Upon asking the butcher there, it didn&amp;rsquo;t like that would have helped either as they were only able to understand Spanish. So I left and decided I would just drink at home. I could&amp;rsquo;ve grabbed some water at the local Fuzzy&amp;rsquo;s, but I thought it wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did find of worth however was a water fountain station I managed to spot at a nearby park. This was a mediocre decision, as the water was warm and made me thirstier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;home-stretch-and-more-gear-shift-trouble&#34;&gt;Home Stretch (and More Gear Shift Trouble)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way back was also pretty straightfoward. I did have some problems with the gear shifting, now interfering with my pedalling. It seems like a project is due to get these back to workable condition. Nevertheless I did make it home and managed to get there just before my dad pulled into the driveway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://thedarklynx786.github.io/p/dermalyze/Dermalyze.png" alt="Featured image of post Dermalyze" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is made to advertise Dermalyze, a machine learning project me and a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://cyberneel.design&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; created that analyzes skin conditions through a machine learning model. Though the model was mostly programmed by my friend, I did a lot of the website design and social media post desiging, and it took off! We took it to hackathons and are entering it into the Congressional App Challenge, which we hope to win. You can go support us at our &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/dermalyze/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt;, and our &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://dermalyze.tech/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;website&lt;/a&gt; (which you can also go check out through the links page).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, stating the obvious, if you have a skin condition, please go test our project! We would love to hear feedback about what we made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this experience, I&amp;rsquo;m likely going to create a machine learning project of my own, as I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot through this experience. You can even see that I reused the website theme for our project site for my own lol. Keep an eye out for more posts to see what I&amp;rsquo;m going to be up to in the (hopefully) near future.&lt;/p&gt;
